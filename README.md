# About
-   Draw a *Pikachu* on Python using the [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) module.
-   The program will paint out the **background** first. It will consist of the sky, grass, clouds and sun. This process will take about **2.5 minutes** since the background is gradient color. 
-   If you don't want the background, comment out the draw background function towards the end of the `main.py` code like this.

```python
# draw_background()
```
